Start-BackupTool is an interactive CLI-based PowerShell script that streamlines and automates the process of backing up user data (either local or remote) stored in the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and Pictures directories to their Active Directory Home Directory. Also backs up Google Chrome shortcuts.

Data restoration as shortcuts is a work in progress.

This script is useful for quickly backing up user data in situations where a machine is being replaced or decommissioned. This is particularly helpful in environments not leveraging roaming profiles.
